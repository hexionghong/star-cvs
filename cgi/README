Purpose of Package: This package is a set of CGI scripts written in
PERL, which form the framework for the Automated QA and Testing of the

and reports a variety of performance and quality information through a
web-based interface. The QA-related data are extracted from the log
file of the run and set of QA ROOT macros that are run by the scripts.
