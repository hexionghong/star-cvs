		Brief Description of Package Use


	Build all packages from the STAR library.  This is the STR
package --  the STAR string manipulation and math routines.

	To build STR on VMS -- need to build strlib.olb & strlib_dbg.olb:

	a) Extract STR_DEFINE.COM from STR_REF into the current
	default directory.

	b) Edit STR_DEFINE.COM to define the logical
	STARSTR.  Sample lines are included, commented out, with
	defaults provided wherever possible, corresponding to a
	session on CSA.  The logical STARSTR has no default, and
	must be provided by the user (eg, the default directory
	should serve well for this).  This is the destination for
	the object code from the source library STR_REF. If locally
	edited copies of sources are to be used, edit
	STR_DEFINE.COM to redefine the logical STR_REF to be the
	local source directory. 

	c) Set the default directory to be the same as STARSTR: . 

	d) Execute STR_REF:MAKESTR.COM ;  strlib.olb & strlib_dbg.olb
	should now be built. 



	To build STR on Unix -- need to build libstr.a:

	a) From an STR-updated VMS host, set default to STR_REF
	and run FTP.  Issue the "TAKE FTPSTR.COM" command to ftp,
	which should copy over the files, then exit FTP.  It
	may be necessary to modify FTPSTR.COM to conform to
	individual variations in the placement of the str directory.

	b) Log on the the now-updated Unix machine, and change
	directory to the str directory.  Then type "make str",
	and libstr.a should be built.



	At the moment, no verbose documentation of this package exists.
However, the routines in STRLIB.FOR, STRLIB_VMS.FOR and STRMTH.FOR are
fairly well commented.
