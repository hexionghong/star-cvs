<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRLIST_NOLFCR(MSG,LUN)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) MSG !Character string to be output.
	INTEGER LUN !Logical unit on which to output (terminal).

*  Description:
*	Output a one-line message without a preceding line feed
*	or a following carriage-return on a terminal-emulating
*	listing-file.
*	Actual outputing is deferred until a STRLIST_NOLF
*	call is made, at which time the message specified in that
*	latter call is appended to previously-specified output
*	and then output.  A call to STRLIST will wipe out any
*	characters from a STRLIST_NOCR or STRLIST_NOLFCR call.
*	MSG is appended to any existing characters in
*	previously-specified output in a STRLIST_NOCR or STRLIST_NOLFCR
*	call.

*	It is illegal to call this routine before a call to any one of
*	STRLIST, STRLIST_NOCR or STRLIST_NOLF.
