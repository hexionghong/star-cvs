	                     ASC_DATE,ASC_WEEKDAY,ASC_TIME)</h3>


*  Input/Output:
	INTEGER TCPU_TIME(2) !Total "absolute" CPU time since last
	                     !call to STRCPU0.  Input value is used
	                     !to get DCPU_TIME.

*  Outputs:
	INTEGER DCPU_TIME(2) !CPU time-difference between input and
	                     !output values of TCPU_TIME.
	CHARACTER*17 TCPU_ASC !ASCII representation of TCPU_TIME.
	CHARACTER*17 DCPU_ASC !ASCII representation of DCPU_TIME.
	CHARACTER*9 ASC_DATE  !ASCII representation of real date.
	CHARACTER*9 ASC_WEEKDAY !ASCII representation of weekday.
	CHARACTER*8 ASC_TIME  !ASCII representation of real time.

*  Description:
*	Return absolute (since last STRCPU0 call) and delta CPU
*	times, and 9 character ASCII date, 8 character ASCII time,
*	and 9 character ASCII weekday.
