<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_set_char</h3>


*  No arguments

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:
*	Set the terminal into single-character ("punctual") I/O mode.
*	ie, make characters available immediately, without waiting for
*	an EOT (End Of Transmission, eg, a Return, Line Feed, etc.).
*	This is independent of whether terminal I/O is synchronous
*	(reads wait until something is really read) or asynchronous
*	(reads return a null byte if nothing is read).
