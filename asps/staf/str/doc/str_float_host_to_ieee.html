<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STR_FLOAT_HOST_TO_IEEE( Ireal )</h3>


	INTEGER Ireal !Integer-cast of a Host-style floating number.

*  Description:
*	No-op under AIX!

*	Convert Ireal, which is passed to this routine as an integer
*	cast of a Host-style floating number, into an IEEE-style floating
*	number:
*	                       DEC-style
*
*	_31_____________  16_15_________14___________7_6______________0_
*	|fraction (F2) ...  | sign (S) | exponent (E) | fraction (F1)  |
*	|-------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|
*	                 LSB                          MSB
*
*	With the usual:  x = (+/-) f * 2**k
*	"+/-" is "+" is S (bit 15) is 0, and "-" if not.
*	"f" is always positive, and:  1 .GT. f   1/2  .LE. f
*	The leading bit of "f" is always omitted (the "hidden" bit).
*
*	           F1(shifted up 16 bits) + F2(shifted down 16 bits) + 2**23
*	"f"  =   ------------------------------------------------------------
*	                                   2**24
*
*	Note that the MSB of "f" is bit 6, from F1.
*
*	"k" is:   E(shifted down 7 bits)
*
*	Note that bit 14 (in E) is the sign bit of E.  For E=0, S=0, "x" is
*	defined to be zero.  For E=0, S=1, "x" is a reserved operand - illegal.
