<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRPARSEF(CIN,CDEF,COUT)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) CIN !Character string containing a file name, which
*                          may or may not include a file "type" field.
*                          A "type" field are those characters following
*                          the first period "." in a file name, not counting
*                          periods inside VMS-style directory-specifications.
	CHARACTER*(*) CDEF !Character string containing a specified default
*                           file "type" field.  The period is not included.
*  Output:
	CHARACTER*(*) COUT !If CIN contains a "type" field, then COUT is just
*                           a copy of CIN.  Otherwise, COUT is CIN, appended
*                           with a period and then with CDEF.

*  Description:
*	Parse out a file name from CIN and put it in COUT.  If no
*	file type is specified, append the default file type, CDEF.
*	If there is an error with the lengths, (ie, not enough space
*	in COUT), COUT is returned as "strparsef.err".
