<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRCONCAT(ARG,JARG,NARGS,COM)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) ARG(*) !Array of parsed-arguments.
	INTEGER JARG         !Element of ARG with which to start.
	INTEGER NARGS        !Number of arguments in ARG.
*  Output:
	CHARACTER*(*) COM    !Re-combined (concatenated) string of ARGs.

*  Functional description:
*	Recombine the arguments, previously parsed from a single line into
*	ARG, as with STRPARSE, into a single line.  General, this is used
*	to recombine everything but the first argument, so that an otherwise
*	intact command string can be passed "down the line", stripped of its
*	"routing" command.  Arguments are concatenated with intervening spaces.
*	The intervening spaces could be tabs, but not if ARG and NARGS come
*	from STRPARSE.
