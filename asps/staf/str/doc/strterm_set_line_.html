  FORTRAN callable:

	CALL STRTERM_SET_LINE

  No arguments

  Return value:  none ("void")

  Description:
	Set the terminal into "line" I/O mode.  ie, characters are not
	available until an EOT (End Of Transmission, eg, a Return, Line Feed,
	etc.) is sent.
	This is independent of whether terminal I/O is synchronous
	(reads wait until something is really read) or asynchronous
	(reads return a null byte if nothing is read).
