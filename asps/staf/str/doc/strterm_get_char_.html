  FORTRAN callable:

	CALL STRTERM_GET_CHAR( Ichar )
*  Input:
	INTEGER Ichar !Integer-value of character read from the terminal
	              !in either "wait" or "nowait" mode, as set by the
	              !routines STRTERM_SET_WAIT, STRTERM_SET_NOWAIT,
	              !STRTERM_SET_NORMAL STRTERM_SET_LINE, and STRTERM_SET_CHAR.
	              !If in "nowait" mode, and if nothing is in the input
	              !buffer when this routine is called, then Ichar
	              !returns set to zero.  Unfortunately, a Unix bug
	              !renders the same effect on EOF (^D).

  Output:
	integer i1 -- passed by reference (pointer or address).

  Return value:  none ("void")

  Description:
	Get a single character from the terminal, w/o waiting, and without
	waiting for a complete line (ie, no EOT character needed to make
	characters available).
	Return with the null byte as the character if no
	character is ready at the terminal (ie, don't wait).

  Warning:
	A Unix ambiguity fails to distinguish between EOF, sometimes
	indicated with a ^D from an input stream, but otherwise being
	a specific signal from the input device indicating that there
	is no (more) data available, and a "no character avaiable"
	condition.

	This will result in an unpleasant surprise if a program is exitted
	while in nowait mode:       The Unix shell begins receiving
	null bytes from the terminal, instead of waiting for real characters.
	This being indistiguishable under Unix from an EOF, or ^D, the session
	will be immediately ended, and the user logged off!!!
