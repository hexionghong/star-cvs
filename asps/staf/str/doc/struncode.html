<pre><h3>INTEGER FUNCTION STRUNCODE(S,REQRAD,UNINT,UNREAL)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) S         !Character string containing representation.
	INTEGER REQRAD          !Requested radix for conversion - 2,8,10,16.

*  Outputs:
	INTEGER UNINT           !Result as an integer, if possible.
	DOUBLE PRECISION UNREAL !Result as a floating value, unless error.

*  Description:
*	Decode the character string in S as a number.
*	Put the result in UNREAL and UNINT, if possible.
*	Return STRUNCODE = :
*	-1	error - nothing was uncoded.
*	 0	a real number was decoded, but the result was too big
*		to be converted into integer form.
*	 1	a real number was decoded, and exists in integer form, too.

*	To set the default conversion radix to other than 10,
*	set REQRAD to 2, 8, or 16 - otherwise it's assumed decimal.
*	Numbers of radices 2, 8 and 16 are allowed, the radix being
*	indicated by prefixing the ASCII representation of the number
*	with a '%' for radix 2, '"' or 'O' for radix 8, and 'H' or 'X'
*	for radix 16.  The prefix and the number may not be separated
*	by any character, such as a space.
*	If radix 10 is desired and the default radix isn't 10, use the
*	decimal radix indicator '$'.
