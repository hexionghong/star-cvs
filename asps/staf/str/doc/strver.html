<pre><h3>LOGICAL FUNCTION STRVER
	  (FILE_NAME_IN,VLIMIT,VCHAR,VNEXT,FILE_NAME_OUT)</h3>


*	Inputs:

	CHARACTER*(*) FILE_NAME_IN !Unadulterated file name.  Terminated
	                           !with a space or specified in quotes.

	INTEGER VLIMIT !Caller-specified limit to the version number.
	               !If, VNEXT exceeds this STRVER fails.

	CHARACTER*1 VCHAR !One-character version-field delimiter, caller
*                          specified.  eg, ";".

*  Input/Output:
	INTEGER VNEXT !The next version number.  Initialized by caller,
	              !incremented by STRVER each call.

*  Output:
	CHARACTER*(*) FILE_NAME_OUT !Same as FILE_NAME_IN, but with a version
	                            !number appended after an underscore.
	                            !Returns blank if an error occurs.
	                            !If VNEXT is 0, the returned file name
	                            !is exactly the specified file name;
	                            !no underscore or digits are appended.
*  Return values:
*	.true.  -- If a name was successfully generated.
*	.false. -- If a name was not generated, which would occur if VNEXT
*	           is specified as negative, or if VNEXT exceeds VLIMIT, or
*	           if FILE_NAME_IN is blank.

*  Description:
*	Make file "version" numbers & append it to the file name.
*	The file name constructed is "hypothetical", that is, it may
*	or may not work.  It is intended to be used in a FORTRAN OPEN
*	statement as the value to the "FILE=" keyword.  The OPEN
*	statement should specify an error return;  if the STRVER-
*	constructed filename fails in the OPEN, STRVER should be
*	called again, and it will return a new file name, with the
*	next version number, and the process repeated until the OPEN
*	succeeds or until VNEXT is higher than the calling routine's
*	specified limit, VLIMIT.
