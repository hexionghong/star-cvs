<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_set_normal</h3>


*  No arguments

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:
*	Set the terminal into "normal" I/O mode.  ie, wait at a read for
*	input to be typed, and do not make characters available until an
*	EOT (End Of Transmission, eg, a Return, Line Feed, etc.) is sent.
*	Under VMS, this is done at the actual I/O call itself.  Here,
*	software flags are set, but no action is taken.
