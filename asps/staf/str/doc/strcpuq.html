<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRCPUQ(TCPU) !Quad (64-bit) version.</h3>


*  Output:
	INTEGER TCPU(2) !CPU time in "ticks" since last STRCPU0 call.

*  Description:
*	Platform-specific call to get the CPU time in quad-word form.
*	This really only does the same as STRCPU at present, with
*	TCPU being an array instead of single-element.  TCPU(2)
*	always comes back zero.
