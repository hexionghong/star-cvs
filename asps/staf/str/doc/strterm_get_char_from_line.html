<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_get_char_from_line(Long)</h3>


*  Output argument:
	INTEGER Long  !Integer-ASCII-equivalent of transmitted character,
	              !or zero, if nothing is ready.

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:

*	VMS version is not operational -- just for compatability's sake,
*	this issues a call to strterm_get_char, which isn't quite the same.

*  What it should do (and does on Unix):
*	Get a character from the terminal, w/o waiting.
*	Wait for a complete line before transmitting.
*	Return with the null byte as the character if no
*	character is ready at the terminal (ie, don't wait).
