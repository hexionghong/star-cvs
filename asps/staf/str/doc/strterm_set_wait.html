<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_set_wait</h3>


*  No arguments

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:
*	Set the terminal into "wait", or synchronous I/O mode.  ie, if
*	no characters are available at a read,  program flow halts,
*	waiting for something to be transmitted, rather than returning
*	a null byte and continuing.  This is the "normal" mode.
*	Under VMS, this is done at the actual I/O call itself.  Here,
*	software flags are set, but no action is taken.
