<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_set_line</h3>


*  No arguments

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:
*	Set the terminal into "line" I/O mode.  ie, characters are not
*	available until an EOT (End Of Transmission, eg, a Return, Line Feed,
*	etc.) is sent.
*	This is independent of whether terminal I/O is synchronous
*	(reads wait until something is really read) or asynchronous
*	(reads return a null byte if nothing is read).
*	Under VMS, this is done at the actual I/O call itself.  Here,
*	software flags are set, but no action is taken.
