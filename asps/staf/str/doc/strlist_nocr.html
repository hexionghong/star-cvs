<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRLIST_NOCR(MSG,LUN)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) MSG !Character string to be output.
	INTEGER LUN !Logical unit on which to output (terminal).

*  Description:
*	Emulate output of a one-line message without a following
*	carriage return on a terminal-emulating listing-file.
*	Actual outputing is deferred until a STRLIST_NOLF
*	call is made, at which time the message specified in that
*	latter call is appended to previously-specified output
*	and then output.  A call to STRLIST will wipe out any
*	characters from a STRLIST_NOCR or STRLIST_NOLFCR call.
*	Any existing characters in the previously-specified output
*	is overwritten.
