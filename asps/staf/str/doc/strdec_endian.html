<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE STRDEC_ENDIAN(I32)</h3>


*  Input/output:
	INTEGER I32 !32-bit integer to be 16-bit-word "swapped".

*  Description:
*	Swap the two 16-bit half-words in the 32-bit (long) word I32,
*	if needed, to make the big/little endian business come out
*	DEC-style.  On AIX (here), the swapping is done.

*	Compatibility routine.  See STRDEC_ENDIAN_HALF.
