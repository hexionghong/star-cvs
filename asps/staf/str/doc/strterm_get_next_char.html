/*
  Not FORTRAN callable.

  No arguments

  Return value:
	char  -- contains the next byte read from the terminal, or a null if
	nothing is ready, or -1 if some kind of low-level read error occured.

  Description:
	Get a single character from the terminal buffer, w/o waiting (asynchronous),
	and without waiting for a complete line (ie, no EOT character needed to make
	characters available).  Return with the null byte as the character if no
	character is ready at the terminal or in the terminal buffer (ie, don't wait).
	The terminal should be in "char" mode (ie, no EOT required to make characters
	available).

  Warning:
	A Unix ambiguity fails to distinguish between EOF, sometimes
	indicated with a ^D from an input stream, but otherwise being
	a specific signal from the input device indicating that there
	is no (more) data available, and a "no character avaiable"
	condition.

	This will result in an unpleasant surprise if a program is exitted
	while in nowait-character mode:  The Unix shell begins receiving
	null bytes from the terminal, instead of waiting for real characters.
	This being indistiguishable under Unix from an EOF, or ^D, the session
	will be immediately ended, and the user logged off!!!
