/*

  FORTRAN callable:

	LOGICAL STRBYTE_OPENW, Success

	Success = STRBYTE_OPENW( Filename )

*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) Filename !ASCII name of file to be openned as a new file, to be written to.
	                       !It is not necessary for the FORTRAN caller to worry about null-
	                       !terminators;  a null is appended to a local copy of "Filename"
	                       !before being passed to any "ANSI C Routines", or any other "C"
	                       !routines.  This is supposed to be a friendly interface to FORTRAN.


  Inputs:

	 /* (Fortran-hidden:) */
	,size_t filename_length  /*  Filename-length -- Fortran caller doesn't see this.  */

/*  Description:

	Open the new file for writing, named in <filename>, in byte-stream mode.    */
