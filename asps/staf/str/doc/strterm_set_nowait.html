<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE strterm_set_nowait</h3>


*  No arguments

*  Return value:  none

*  Functional description:
*	Set the terminal into "nowait", or asynchronous I/O mode.  ie, if
*	no characters are available at a read, a null byte is returned
*	and program flow continues, rather than waiting for something to be
*	transmitted.
*	Under VMS, this is done at the actual I/O call itself.  Here,
*	software flags are set, but no action is taken.
