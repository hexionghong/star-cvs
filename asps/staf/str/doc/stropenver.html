<pre><h3>LOGICAL FUNCTION STROPENVER(LUN,FILENAME,COMMANDS
	  ,VLIMIT,VCHAR,VERSION,FILE_NAME_OUT)</h3>


*  Inputs:
	INTEGER LUN !Logical unit on which to open file.
	CHARACTER*(*) FILENAME !Name of file.
	CHARACTER*(*) COMMANDS !Command line, through which
                               !OPEN options are selected.

	INTEGER VLIMIT !Caller-specified limit to the version number.
	               !When VERSION exceeds this, STROPENVER fails.

	CHARACTER*1 VCHAR !One-character version-field delimiter, caller
                          !specified.  eg, ";".

*  Outputs:
	INTEGER VERSION !The version number of a successfully opened file.

	CHARACTER*(*) FILE_NAME_OUT !Same as FILENAME, but with a version
	                            !number appended after an underscore.
	                            !Returns blank if an error occurs.
	                            !If VERSION is 0, the returned file name
	                            !is exactly the specified file name;
	                            !no version-field delimiter or digits
	                            !are appended.

*  Return values:
*	.TRUE. for a successful open on: FILENAME//VCHAR//VERSION.
*	.FALSE. for a failed open.


*  Description:
*	Combines the functions of STRVER and STROPEN, providing a simple
*	way to open version-appended files in a machine-independent fashion,
*	using the OPEN parameters specified in COMMANDS.  COMMANDS is a
*	character string containing all the "usual" OPEN parameters, except
*	for the UNIT=lun (FORTRAN Logical Unit) and FILE=filename, which are passed
*	separately, and without the usual single-quotes (apostrophes) normally
*	around literal arguments.
