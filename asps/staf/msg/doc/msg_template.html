<h2>msg Template files</h2>

msg has severl template files, ready to be included into application sources
and editted as needed.  They are:

<dl>
<dt><a href=simple_message.template>Simple Message Template</a>
<dd>How to make and use messages
in the simplest possible way.  This is not the optimal usage as regards CPU usage.

<dt><a href=fast_message.template>Fast (CPU) Message Template</a>
<dd>How to make and use messages
in the most CPU-efficient way.  This is slightly more complicated that the Simple Message Template,
and differs from it only in specifying a fast reference ID (instead of a "-1").  This is more involved
than the Simple form only because of the nature of Fortran, which does not offer a convenient way
of declaring local, static, initialized variables without 3 lines of declarations (ie, INTEGER,
SAVE and DATA).

<dt><a href=full_message.template>Full Message Template</a>
<dd>How to make and use messages in the most general way.
This shows how to generate a message with a Fortran WRITE statement and how to
test a message's enabled-status before devoting resources to that WRITE.

<dt><a href=initialization.template>msg initialization template</a>
<dd>How to initialize msg, and set msg items.  This is generally of use at the
control (ie, TAS or KUIP) level;  most applications do not need to use this.
