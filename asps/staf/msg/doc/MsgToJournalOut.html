/*  Description:  Write a message to the journal (only);  bypass accounting.
	Unconditionally display a message MSG, containing LINES lines
	of up to 132 characters each, on the journal file, if open & enabled.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, unlike standard C practice, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at
	the very end, since this interfaces to FORTRAN, which effectively puts a
	"\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
