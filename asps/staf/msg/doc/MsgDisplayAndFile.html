/* Description:  Display a message on standard out and echo on stream.
	Conditionally display the message msg on standard output and echo it to stream.
	The message is displayed unless disabled.
	The message is counted unless counting is disabled.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at the very end, since msg puts
	a "\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.                 */
