/* Description:  Display and log a message, bypassing msg accounting.
	Display (always) a message msg on standard out and the journal, if enabled by a
	call to MsgJournalOn.
	The message may not be disabled.
	The message is not counted.
	This is the "pure" I/O part of MsgDisplay.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, unlike standard C practice, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at
	the very end, since this interfaces to FORTRAN, which effectively puts a
	"\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.                           */
