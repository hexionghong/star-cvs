/*  Description:  Issue an ASCII command to msg.
	Set the MSG package parameters on individual messages, referenced
	by prefix, according to arguments contained in a single character-
	string command contained in COM.  Commands take these forms:

	To list a summary of msg prefixes' CPU usages:
	CPU

	To examine the summary page length:
	GETLINES

	To examine the shared memory ID (shmid):
	GETSHMID

	To examine the node name:
	GETNODE

	To list the available commands:
	HELP

	To list a summary of msg prefixes:
	LIST

	To have time-stamps occur on a changed CPU time (in addition to
	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
	TIMESTAMP CPU

	To have time-stamps not occur on a changed CPU time (ie, only
	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
	TIMESTAMP NOCPU

	To set the number of lines per page in the summary-output:
	LINES line-count

	To set the node name:
	SETNODE <nodename>

	To load the entire Msg state from an Msg state file:
	LOAD <filename>

	To store the entire Msg state to an Msg state file:
	STORE <filename>

	To set message-abort-limits on specific messages:
	ABORT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

	To enable specific alarms:
	ALARM prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To disable specific alarms, but to continue counting their occurances and displaying messages:
	NOALARM prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To resume counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
	COUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To stop counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
	NOCOUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To delete prefixes:
	DELETE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To disable specific messages, but to continue counting their occurances:
	DISABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To enable specific messages:
	ENABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To get the complete state of specific messages:
	GET prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To set the level on specific alarms:
	LEVEL prefix-1=level-1 prefix-2=level-2 ... prefix-n=level-1

	To set message-limits on specific messages:
	LIMIT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

	To set the state of specific messages:
	SET prefix-1=countLimit-1,level-1,abortLimit-1,active(T/F),counting(T/F),alarming(T/F)> 

	Spacing is not critical in the command line, provided at least one
	or more spaces, tabs or commas separate the arguments.
	The "=" symbols in the LIMIT command are essential, but spaces around
	it are optional and not at all critical.

	Wildcards are permitted in the prefix specifications.

  Returns:
	TRUE for successful completion of command,
	FALSE for failure.                                                    */
