/*  Description:  Issue an ASCII command to msg.
	Set the MSG package parameters on individual messages, referenced
	by prefix, according to arguments contained in a single character-
	string command contained in COM.  Commands take these forms:

	To disable specific messages, but to continue counting their occurances:
	DISABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To enable specific messages:
	ENABLE prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To resume counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
	COUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To stop counting of message occurances, whether or not disabled:
	NOCOUNT prefix-1 prefix-2 ... prefix-n

	To set message-limits on specific messages:
	LIMIT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

	To set message-abort-limits on specific messages:
	ABORT prefix-1=limit-1 prefix-2=limit-2 ... prefix-n=limit-n

	To set the number of lines per page in the summary-output:
	LINES line-count

	To have time-stamps occur on a changed CPU time (in addition to
	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
	TIMESTAMP CPU

	To have time-stamps not occur on a changed CPU time (ie, only
	getting them on changed real-time or node-name):
	TIMESTAMP NOCPU

	Spacing is not critical in the command line, provided at least one
	or more spaces, tabs or commas separate the arguments.
	The "=" symbols in the LIMIT command are essential, but spaces around
	it are optional and not at all critical.

	Wildcards are permitted in the prefix specifications.
