<h2>MSG Classes</h2>


Each MSG prefix is assigned to a class according to this scheme:
<dl>
<dt>If the prefix contains a "-", its class is the first character.
<dt>If the prefix contains a "-", its class is the first character
after the "-", if non-blank.
<dt>If the prefix ends with a "-" or has no "-", it is assigned
to the null class.
</dl>
<p>
The MSG class to which a prefix is assigned is used (soley) for the
purpose of setting the prefix's state and limits (count and abort).
Classes permit the assignment of a variety of default MSG states
and counts for diffent groups of messages.  The predefined MSG
classes are these:

<pre>
Class Description            State    Count Limit    Abort Limit

 ""   No-class message       Active       50            None
  A   Abort message          Active      None        Abort on 1st (MSG abort)
  B   Bug message            Active      None           None
  D   Debug message          Active      None           None
  E   Error message          Active       20            None
  F   Fatal message          Active      None           None (Application abort)
  I   Informative message    Active      None           None
  T   Trace message        Inactive      None           None
  W   Warning message        Active       10            None
</pre>
These can be changed or new classes added with a call to MSG_Class_Define.
