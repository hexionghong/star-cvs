( const char *Prefix, int *ID, int length )
/*  Fortran callable interface to msg;  Fortran equivalent to:
	SUBROUTINE			MSG_Mark( Prefix, ID )

*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) Prefix !MSG prefix.

*  Input/Output:
	INTEGER ID     !Fast-reference MSG ID.  Uniquely assigned on first call.

	INCLUDE 'msg_inc'

*  Description:  Set the given Prefix's "Marked CPU time" to current.
	When this prefix occurs in a call to an MSG routine which does Msg accounting
	(eg, Message), and when that Prefix has had its "Marked CPU time" set (ie,
	to non-zero), that prefix's "total CPU time" is incremented by Current CPU
	time, less the "Marked CPU time".  The Marked CPU time is then zeroed.
