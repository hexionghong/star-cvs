                       !looking up or entering the prefix contained in msg
                       !(prefix is everything before the first space) in
	               !the index of MSG message prefixes.
	               !If ID is negative, ID remains unchanged, and lookup
	               !is then always by prefix.
*   Description:  Display and log a message.

	on the terminal and the journal, if enabled by a
