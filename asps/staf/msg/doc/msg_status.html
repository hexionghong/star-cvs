<h2>MSG Enabled Tests</h2>

There are two MSG routines which return the enabled-status of a specified
message-prefix:  MSG_Enabled and MSG_Enabled_Trace, which perform full MSG
accounting and increment the specified message-prefix's counter each time it is called
if counting is enabled but display is disabled (ie, if the status is "Counting", but
neither "Active" nor "Inactive").
Each of these expects a full-accounting MSG call within their conditional
blocks to do the counting if the prefix is "Active";  they do not do counting
when a prefix is active because double-counting would occur in such cases
(ie, one count for the MSG_Enabled call, then another for the same occurance
of the same prefix by the nested Message call).
The difference in these two calls is strictly in how they handle a new,
previously undefined prefix:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>MSG_Enabled ------- defines a new prefix to be "Acitve".
<dt>MSG_Enabled_Trace -- defines a new prefix to be "Inacitve".
</dl>
<p>
MSG_Enabled is meant to define a conditional MSG
block in which various (possibly CPU-expensive) operations are performed,
for the purpose of generating an informative message when a certain
condition arises, but which may be disabled if desired.
On the other
hand, MSG_Enabled_Trace exists for a different purpose, namely to provide
a mechanism for inserting normally-invisible debugging-type code-flow
trace-messages, which are enabled only when specifically requested.
MSG_Enabled_Trace will define a previously undefined prefix, but sets it
to the "Inactive" state, in which it neither counts nor displays.
