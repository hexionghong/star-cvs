<h2>MSG Enabled Test</h2>


MSG_Enabled returns the enabled-status of a specified message-prefix.
MSG_Enabled is meant to define a conditional MSG
block in which various (possibly CPU-expensive) operations are performed,
for the purpose of generating an informative message when a certain
condition arises, but which may be disabled if desired.  If a prefix
has not yet been defined to the MSG package when first encountered by
a MSG_Enabled call, it is defined according to its class.  Messages
of all predefined classes, except "T" (Trace), are defined "enabled".
