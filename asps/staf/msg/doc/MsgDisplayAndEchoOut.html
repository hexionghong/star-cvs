/* Description:  Display a message on the terminal and echo on a FORTRAN LUN.
	Display (always) a message msg on standard out and echo it to LUN.
	The message may not be disabled.
	The message is not counted.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, unlike standard C practice, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at
	the very end, since this interfaces to FORTRAN, which effectively puts a
	"\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
