( const char *msg, int *Lines, int *LUN, int msglen )
/*  Fortran callable interface to msg;  Fortran equivalent to:
	SUBROUTINE			MSG_to_LUN_Out( msg, Lines, LUN )

*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) msg(*) !1 or more line character-string message submitted for display.
	INTEGER       Lines  !Number of lines in msg.
	INTEGER       LUN    !Fortran logical unit number for msg to be written to.

*  Description:  Write a message to a Fortran LUN;  bypass accounting.
	Display a message, containing one or more lines of no particular
	length (or length-limit), on Fortran logical unit LUN.

	This routine ends by flushing the output buffer.
	Without this, a crash leaves the last several lines of the output to
	LUN not in the listing file -- a terrible thing indeed for debugging.
