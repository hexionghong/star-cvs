( const char *msg, int *Lines, int msglen )
/*  Fortran callable interface to msg;  Fortran equivalent to:
	SUBROUTINE			Message_Out( msg, Lines )

*   Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) msg(*) !1 or more line character-string message
	                     !submitted for display.
	INTEGER        Lines !Number of lines in MSG.

*   Description:  Display and log a message, bypassing msg accounting.
	Always display a message msg, containing Lines lines
	on the terminal and the journal, if
	enabled by a call to Msg_Journal_On.  Displaying is unnaffected
	by calls to the Msg_Disable routine, and the message is not
	"counted".  This is the "pure" I/O part of Message.
