<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_to_LUN_Out( msg, Nlines, LUN )</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) msg(*) !1 or more line character-string message submitted for display.
	INTEGER       Nlines !Number of lines in MSG.
	INTEGER       LUN    !FORTRAN logical unit number for MSG to be written to.

*  Brief description:  Write a message to a FORTRAN LUN;  bypass accounting.

*  Description:
*	Display a message, containing one or more lines of no particular
*	length (or length-limit), on FORTRAN logical unit LUN.

*	This routine ends with a call to STRFlush( LUN ), flushing the output
*	output buffer.  This seems to be necessary to get some machines to
*	keep the LUN file (or terminal) up-to-date;  without this, a crash
*	leaves the last several lines of the output to LUN not in the listing
*	file -- a terrible thing indeed for debugging:
