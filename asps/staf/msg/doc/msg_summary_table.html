<h2>MSG Summary Output</h2>

A call to MSG_Summary( LUN ) will output the MSG summary table to
logical unit LUN.  A call to MSG_Summary_Event( LUN, Events ),
with caller-specified event-count Events, produces the same table
but with an extra column, being the number of counts of each prefix
divided by Events, if not zero.  The summary has a one-line entry
for each prefix, with information about each organized into columns.
The columns are:

<dl>
<dt>	1)  Message-Prefix & Truncated Sample of last occurance <dd>This is
	(up to) 64 characters of the last message dispatched through MSG
	which has this prefix.

<p>
<dt>	2)  Counts   <dd>This is the number of occurances of this prefix while
	counting was enabled for this prefix (Counting can be disabled).
<p>
<dt>	2a) Counts/evt <dd>MSG_Summary_Event only -- this is the occurance
	frequency, with respect to a caller-specified event count.
<p>
<dt>	3)  Limit   <dd>This it the count-limit, after which messages with this
	prefix stop producing output.  They continue to count.
<p>
<dt>	4)  Lookups  <dd>This is the number of times each prefix had to be
	looked up, as a character-string search, in the prefix table.  Optimal
	usage puts this at (max) one per prefix, though infrequently occuring
	messages can be harmlessly specifed (in the Message call, for example)
	with a fast-reference ID of -1 (no ID), in which case Lookups = Counts.
<p>
<dt>	5)  AbortLimit  <dd>This is the count beyond which (if AbortLimit is
	positive) program execution will terminate from within MSG.
<p>
<dt>	6)  State    <dd>One of:

<dl>
<dt>	      Active  <dd>Prefix is active -- messages are displayed and counting.
<dt>	    Counting  <dd>Prefix is inactive, but counting continues.
<dt>	    Inactive  <dd>Prefix is inactive -- messages are neither displayed nor counted.
<dt>	     Aborted  <dd>Prefix exceeded the abort limit and aborted the program.
	              Only one prefix will have this state, at most, and only
	              if the table was produced by an MSG abort.
</dl>
</dl>
The number of lines in a summary output page defaults to 66, but may be set
with a call to MSG_Set_Summary_Page_Length( Lines ) .
