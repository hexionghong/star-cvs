	Conditionally display & count a message MSG, containing LINES lines
	of up to 132 characters each, on LUN.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, unlike standard C practice, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at
	the very end, since this interfaces to FORTRAN, which effectively puts a
	"\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
