/* Description:  Display and log a message.
	Conditionally display a message msg on standard out and the journal,
	if enabled by a call to MsgJournalOn.
	The message is displayed unless disabled.
	The message is counted unless counting is disabled.
	If the prefix in msg is undefined, it is defined at this call and set to
	the default state for its class (see MsgClassDefine).

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at the very end, since msg puts
	a "\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.  */
