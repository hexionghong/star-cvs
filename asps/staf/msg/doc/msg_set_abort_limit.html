<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Set_Abort_Limit( Prefix, Limit )</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) Prefix !A STAR-standard message prefix.
	INTEGER Limit !Maximum no. of times to display a message before aborting.

*  Brief description:  Set abort limit for a prefix.

*  Description:
*	Set the abort limit for the message recognized by Prefix;
*	Program termination results when the prefix's
*	count has exceeded Limit.  Wildcards are permitted.
*	The existing count-limit (after which message-display is disabled
*	for Prefix), is set to the same value -- aborting msg calls
*	should not be quiet without deliberate intervention (ie, re-specify
*	the count-limit after this call to obtain silent aborts -- don't
*	do it!).
