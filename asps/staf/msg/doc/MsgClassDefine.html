/* Description:  Define a new msg class (of prefixes).
	Each msg prefix is assigned to a class according to this scheme:

	     * If the prefix contains a "-", its class is the first character
	       after the "-", if non-blank.

	     * If the prefix ends with a "-" or has no "-", it is assigned
	       to the null class.

	The MSG class to which a prefix is assigned is used (soley) for the
	purpose of setting the prefix's state and limits (count and abort).
	Classes permit the assignment of a variety of default MSG states
	and counts for diffent groups of messages.  The predefined MSG
	classes are these:

	Class Description            State    Count Limit    Abort Limit

	 ""   No-class message       Active       50            None
	  A   Abort message          Active      None        Abort on 1st (msg abort)
	  B   Bug message            Active      None           None
	  C   Count-only message   Counting      None           None
	  D   Debug message          Active      None           None (Often the 1st incarnation of a T class)
	  E   Error message          Active       20            None
	  F   Fatal message          Active      None           None (Application abort)
	  I   Informative message    Active      None           None
	  O   Once-only message      Active        1            None
	  T   Trace message        Inactive      None           None
	  W   Warning message        Active       10            None

	These can be changed or new classes added with a call to this routine.

	Conditionally display a message msg on standard out and the journal,
	if enabled by a call to MsgJournalOn.  The message is displayed
	unless disabled.  The message is counted unless counting is disabled.  */
