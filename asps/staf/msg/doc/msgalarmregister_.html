( funcPoint AlarmRoutine )
/*  Fortran callable interface to msg;  Fortran equivalent to:
	SUBROUTINE			MsgAlarmRegister( AlarmRoutine )

*   Input:
	EXTERNAL AlarmRoutine ! Application-specified Alarm routine to use by msg.
* Description:   Register an alarm-routine to be called by active-alarm messages.  For Fortran.
	         Note that if "alarmroutine" is defined as a c-procedure, its name as defined
	         must contain the suffix "_" and must be in lower-case, in order to be used
	         with this call.  If it does not contain the suffix "_" or is not all in lower
	         case, the call must be made from a c-procedure, in which case a call to
	         MsgAlarmRegister is better than msgalarmregister_ .
