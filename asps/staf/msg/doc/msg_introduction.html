<h2>Introduction</h2>

MSG is a set of calls intended to facilitate the display, logging, control
and general accounting of messages generated from within application code.
MSG attempts to do this with a minimum of labor on the part of the programmer
without compromising CPU efficiency or restricting message content.
<p>

The MSG routines have the prefix "MSG_", except for "Message" (and "
Message_Out").  "Message" calls are ubiquitous, and as such are an 
exception to the general STAR rule, which would require it to have the 
somewhat ridiculous name "MSG_Message".

<p>
This document contains a full description for each routine, as well as
sample coding templates, and various descriptions of different aspects
of MSG.
