<h2>Introduction</h2>

"Message Handling" in this document means the display and journal-logging 
of any messages whose purpose is to inform software operators in real-time 
of possible action that must be taken by the operators, and affects only
"permanent" code, installed or intended to be installed in the STAR 
software library(s) or otherwise for use within the "public" domain of the 
STAR collaboration.  This does not pertain to such things as interactive 
dialogs, general status displays, etc.  It is not the intention here to 
restrict the usage of any "temporary" displays or other "personal" 
debugging aids, with the sole provision that such things must not find 
their way into the public domain, including (and especially) the STAR 
library.
<p>

The MSG routines have the prefix "MSG_", except for "Message" (and "
Message_Out").  "Message" calls are ubiquitous, and as such are an 
exception to the general STAR rule, which would require it to have the 
somewhat ridiculous name "MSG_Message".
