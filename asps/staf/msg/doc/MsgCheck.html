/*   Description:  Lookup a prefix, define new ones, return fast-ref ID.
	Find the character string consisting of MSG's prefix in the
	index of message prefixes (sic).  If found
	in the index, return the index ID and the flags Active
	and Counting.  If ID is specified as positive,
	a lookup in the index is not preformed, but a
	check that ID is in the index and a check that
	MSG's prefix agrees with the stored message
	prefix selected by ID are made.  If the stored prefix
	does not agree with msg's prefix, MsgCheck issues an error
	message (which indicates a program bug!), then zeros ID and starts
	again, with ID set to the correct index ID if MSG's prefix is in the
	index, and entering MSG's prefix if it is not in the index.
	If not found, the prefix is entered in the index.
	The flags Active and Counting are set according to the whether the
	message is active (output enabled) and enabled for counting.
