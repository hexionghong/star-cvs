<h2>MSG Prefixes</h2>

Messages must all contain, in the beginning of the message, a unique 
identifier, or "prefix", which serves to uniquely and unambiguously 
identify the source, in the code, of the message.  The prefix should (but 
need not, as far as the MSG package is concerned) be the name of the 
routine which generates the message, followed by a dash "-", and the dash 
followed by a character or characters which uniquely identifies the source 
of the message within that routine.  The "body" of the message, if there 
is one, must be separated from the prefix by one or more ASCII spaces, 
tabs , newlines (ie, carriage return characters, ASCII 10.), formfeeds 
(ASCII 12 .) or nulls (ASCII 0.).

<h2>MSG Fast Reference IDs</h2>

Each prefix is assigned by MSG a unique "fast reference ID", which is
then used to access the accounting and status information for that
prefix in a more cpu-efficient way than ASCII string searches in
subsequent references to a particular prefix.  The caller need only
supply an integer, declared with SAVE (ie, static), and initialized
to zero, in addition to a prefix or prefix-containing message, and
MSG does the rest.  For the purpose of labor-reduction, an option
is provided within MSG which prevents the setting of fast-reference
IDs if an MSG call is made with an ID of -1.  In this case, an ASCII
string lookup is always preformed, but the application writer saves
a little jockeying around in the code, specifying IDs.  This is more
than adequate for cases in which a message will rarely or never occur
(ie, a bug-check message -- one that hopefully never occurs unless
the program doesn't work as intended).
