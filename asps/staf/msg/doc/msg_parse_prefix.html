<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Parse_Prefix( Prefix, Prefix_stripped, Prefix_number)</h3>


*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) Prefix !STAR-standard messsage prefix.

*  Outputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) Prefix_stripped !Prefix stripped of trailing digits.
	INTEGER Prefix_number !Prefix trailing digits, decoded as integer.
	                      !If there are no trailing digits, set to zero.

*  Brief description:  Parse a prefix into a string and a number.

*  Description:
*	Parse the specified STAR-standard message prefix "Prefix" into two
*	components:
*	1)	The prefix without trailing digits,
*	2)	The trailing digits, converted to an integer.
*	The principal use of this is for sorting, to preserve the sequence
*	1,2,3...8,9,10,11, etc., instead of the straight ASCII sequence,
*	which would go as 1,10,11,...,2,20,21,... etc.

*	Note that classes are irrelevant to this purpose, and are ignored.

*	Called in msglib.f in MSG_Summary.
