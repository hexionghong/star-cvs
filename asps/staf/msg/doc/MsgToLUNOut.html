/*  Description:  Write a message to a FORTRAN LUN;  bypass accounting.
	Display a message, containing one or more lines of no particular
	length (or length-limit), on FORTRAN logical unit LUN.

	This routine ends with a call to STRFlush( LUN ), flushing the output
	output buffer.  This seems to be necessary to get some machines to
	keep the LUN file (or terminal) up-to-date;  without this, a crash
	leaves the last several lines of the output to LUN not in the listing
	file -- a terrible thing indeed for debugging:

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters, and the caller is
	expected to specify a "\n" character at the end of a message, according
	to standard C practice.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
