/* Description:  Display and log a message.
	Conditionally display a message msg on standard out and the journal,
	if enabled by a call to MsgJournalOn.  The message is displayed
	unless disabled.  The message is counted unless counting is disabled.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at the very end, since msg puts
	a "\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.  */
