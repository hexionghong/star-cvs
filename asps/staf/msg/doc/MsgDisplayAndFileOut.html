/* Description:  Display a message on standard out and echo on fid.
	Display (always) the message msg on standard output and echo it to fid.
	The message may not be disabled.
	The message is not counted.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at the very end, since msg puts
	a "\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.                 */
