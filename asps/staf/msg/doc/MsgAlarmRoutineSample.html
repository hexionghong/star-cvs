/*  Description:  Msg sample alarm routine.  Specify in MsgAlarmRegister call.
	Applications may create their own msg alarm routine, with the arguments being
	the same as specified in this sample.

	This routine will be called on the occurance of any (message) prefix which
	is alarm-enabled (designated by "!Active!" on the summary listing,
	enabled with the MsgEnableAlarm call).

	All arguments are filled by Msg before this routine is called, and are
	derived from the originating message.

	Prefix     is the stripped off prefix from the alarm-originating message.
	sansPrefix is the rest of the message (ie, without the prefix or intervening space).
	Level      is the alarm level, set by a MsgSetLevel call, and has application-defined
	           meaning (Level has no meaning in this sample routine).
