<h2>MSG Time and Node Stamps</h2>


The routines Message, Message_Out, MSG_to_Journal and MSG_to_Journal_Out
all put a date-time-node-stamp in the journal file, if opened and enabled,
preceding the output message.  This date-time-node stamp is omitted if
the stamp is identical to the previous stamp used;  MSG outputs a stamp
to the journal file at most once per second, unless messages from different
nodes occur.  In addition to the date, time and node appearing on the stamp,
the total elapsed real and CPU time, since the MSG_Ini call, also appear on
the stamp.  The elapsed real time may be reset with a call to STRELA0, and
the elapsed CPU time reset with STRCPU0 (see package "STR").
