<h2>MSG Aborts</h2>

Each message-prefix, when first defined, is given an "abort limit"
of zero, which means there is no abort limit.  By setting an abort
limit with the subroutine MSG_Set_Abort_Limit( Prefix, Limit ),
or with MSG_Set_by_Command( Command ), with Command:

<pre>
   ABORT Prefix=Limit
</pre>

will cause MSG to abort program execution when the specified prefix
has counted up to the abort limit.  A message indicates the abort,
and an MSG Summary is output to the journal file, if active.
