/* Description:  Set Msg up to share its memory.
	         When this routine returns >0, the memory is being shared.
	         This should be the very first Msg call.
	         If a journal file was open at the time of this call, it is closed.
	         The journal will need to be reopened if it had been open.
	         If the segment doesn't exist, a new one will not be created.

   Returns:
	shmid if successful,
	-1 for failure.                                                          */
