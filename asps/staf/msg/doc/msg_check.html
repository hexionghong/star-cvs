<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Check( MSG, ID, Active, Counting )</h3>


*  Input:
	CHARACTER*(*) MSG !A STAR-standard message, with prefix.
	                  !MSG can be just a prefix.

*  Input/output:
	INTEGER ID !STAR-standard message ID.  Set to zero by caller 
                   !before first call, set by Message on first call by
                   !looking up or entering the prefix contained in MSG
                   !(prefix is everything before the first space) in
	           !the index of STAR-standard message prefixes.

*  Outputs:
	LOGICAL Active !Flag set to .TRUE. if the message selected
                       !(by prefix and/or ID) is active.
	LOGICAL Counting !Flag set to .TRUE. if the message selected
                         !(by prefix and/or ID) is enabled for counting.

*  Brief description:  Lookup a prefix, define new ones, return fast-ref ID.

*   Description:
*	Find the character string consisting of MSG's prefix in the
*	index of STAR-standard message prefixes (sic).  If found
*	in the index, return the index ID and the flags Active
*	and Counting.  If ID is specified as positive,
*	a lookup in the index is not preformed, but a
*	check that ID is in the index and a check that
*	MSG's prefix agrees with the stored STAR-standard message
*	prefix selected by ID are made.  If the stored prefix
*	does not agree with MSG's prefix, MSG_Check issues an error
*	message (which indicates a program bug!), then zeros ID and starts
*	again, with ID set to the correct index ID if MSG's prefix is in the
*	index, and entering MSG's prefix if it is not in the index.
*	If not found, the prefix is entered in the index.
*	The flags Active and Counting are set according to the whether the
*	message is active (output enabled) and enabled for counting.

*   Return conditions:  none

*   Error conditions:  none

*	Called in msglib.f .
