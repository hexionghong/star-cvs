/*  Description:  Write a node and time (real and CPU) stamp to a FORTRAN LUN, if new.
	"Stamp" the date and time on a line on FORTRAN logical unit LUN.
	"Stamp" the node-name on the same line, if node-name has been specified
	with a "call msg_name_node(<node_name>)".
	Also stamps an elapsed real-time counter and an elapsed CPU-time counter,
	as 17-character ASCII strings.

	Produces output only if different than the previous output from
	this subroutine.  eg, a call to this routine in a tight loop will
	only produce an actual time-stamp once each second.
