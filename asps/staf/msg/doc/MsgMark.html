	Set the given Prefix's "Marked CPU time" to current.  When this prefix
	occurs in a call to an MSG routine which does MSG accounting (eg, Message),
	and when that Prefix has had its "Marked CPU time" set (ie, to non-zero),
	that prefix's "total CPU time" is incremented by Current CPU time, less
	the "Marked CPU time".  The Marked CPU time is then zeroed.
