	Conditionally display & count a message msg on the journal file, if open & enabled.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters.
	However, the caller should NOT include a "\n" at the very end, since msg puts
	a "\n" at the very end.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.  */
