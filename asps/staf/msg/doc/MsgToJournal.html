	Conditionally display & count a message MSG, containing LINES lines
	of up to 132 characters each, on the journal file, if open & enabled.

	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters, and the caller is
	expected to specify a "\n" character at the end of a message, according
	to standard C practice.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
