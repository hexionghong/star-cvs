<pre><h3>SUBROUTINE			MSG_Class_Define( Class, State, Count_Limit, Abort_Limit )</h3>


*  Inputs:
	CHARACTER*(*) Class       !A STAR-standard message class.
	CHARACTER*(*) State       !'Active', 'Count' or 'Inactive'.
	INTEGER       Count_Limit !Default count-limit for this class.
	INTEGER       Abort_Limit !Default count-limit for this class.

*  Brief description:  Define a new MSG class (of prefixes).

*  Description:
*	Each MSG prefix is assigned to a class according to this scheme:

*	     * If the prefix contains a "-", its class is the first character
*	       after the "-", if non-blank.

*	     * If the prefix ends with a "-" or has no "-", it is assigned
*	       to the null class.

*	The MSG class to which a prefix is assigned is used (soley) for the
*	purpose of setting the prefix's state and limits (count and abort).
*	Classes permit the assignment of a variety of default MSG states
*	and counts for diffent groups of messages.  The predefined MSG
*	classes are these:

*	Class Description            State    Count Limit    Abort Limit

*	 ""   No-class message       Active       50            None
*	  A   Abort message          Active      None        Abort on 1st (msg abort)
*	  B   Bug message            Active      None           None
*	  D   Debug message          Active      None           None
*	  E   Error message          Active       20            None
*	  F   Fatal message          Active      None           None (Application abort)
*	  I   Informative message    Active      None           None
*	  T   Trace message        Inactive      None           None
*	  W   Warning message        Active       10            None

*	These can be changed or new classes added with a call to this routine.
