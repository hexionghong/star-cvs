/* Description:  Display a message on the terminal and echo on a FORTRAN LUN.
	Conditionally display a message msg on standard out and echo it to LUN.
	The message is displayed unless disabled.
	The message is counted unless counting is disabled.
	Note that unlike the FORTRAN message call, there is no "Lines" argument;
	lines are defined with "\n" (newline) characters, and the caller is
	expected to specify a "\n" character at the end of a message, according
	to standard C practice.  msg may have as many newlines as desired.
