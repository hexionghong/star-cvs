<title>C-Fortran Interface Package</title>
<h1>c4t - The C-Fortran interface package</h1>
This package is a collection of things which help with
interfacing C and FORTRAN routines within the same program.<p>
c4t created by <a href=spb_l/olson.html>D. Olson.</a><p>

<h2>cfortran.h</h2>
The <em>cfortran.h</em> tool was developed and is
supported by Burhard Burow at Desy.
It is used for some TAS routines and the cfortran.h header file
is sometimes required for C routines.<p>
The <a href=cfortran.doc>cfortran.doc</a> document describes its use.
It does a lot and should be used with some care.
The version of the cfortran.h header file installed for use
in the STAR library has the modification for use with the GNU C
compiler, gcc.<p>
The f2h program in the CERN library, starting in 93, will generate
cfortran.h compatible header files that permit calling FORTRAN
routines from C.  The header files generated by f2h should be
carefully checked since many times some modifications are needed.
