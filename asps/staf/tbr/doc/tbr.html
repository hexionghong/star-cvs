<h2> Introduction </h2>
The table browser lets you look at table conveniently.  It has a cuts
mechanism so that you can make complicated row selections, eg,
<pre>
  ((id.gt.1000.and.id.lt.2000).and.inpt.gt.5).or.(npt.lt.30)
</pre>
It is a GUI program that uses the mouse for nearly everything.
It runs both<ul>
<li>inside of TAS++ (both static and dynamic tables)
<li>at the UNIX prompt (.xdf files)
</ul>

<h2>To run inside of TAS++</h2>
The table browser is only available in TAS++.  To make TAS++ instead
of TAS, uncomment the MOTIF:= line in your bin/Makefile.
After you have the TAS prompt, to bring up the browser type
<pre>                  dspace/show -b</pre>

<h2>To run at the UNIX prompt</h2>
From the UNIX prompt type
<pre>        /u2/ward/tbr/bin/$STAR_ARCH/tbr myfile.xdf</pre>
You can generate <code>.xdf</code> files from TAS tables by
typing, for example,
<pre>        data_io/write myfile.xdf xdf table1 table2</pre>

<h2>Using the GUI interface</h2>

<strong>The primary window</strong> comes up immediately.
<ol>
<li>Click on the two-letter abbreviations until you see the table
    that you are interested in.  ("TB" and "tb" stand for "table".)
<li>Click on the <strong>name</strong> (not the abbreviation) for that table.
<li>Wait for the secondary window.
</ol><p>

<strong>The secondary window</strong>
comes up as a result of your actions in the primary window.
<ol>
<li>Click on the columns that you are interested in.
<li>Select which rows you want in the top right corner.
<li>Select a command from the "Action" menu.
