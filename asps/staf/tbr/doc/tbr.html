<h2> Introduction </h2>
The table browser lets you look at tables conveniently.  It has a cuts
mechanism so that you can make complicated row selections, eg,
<pre>
  ((id.gt.1000.and.id.lt.2000).and.inpt.gt.5).or.(npt.lt.30)
</pre>
It is a GUI program that uses the mouse for everything except
typing cuts strings and hard row ranges (eg, rows 2001 to 3000).
It is the simplest way currently available to look at dynamic tables.
It make simple histograms.  Its design is modularized, so that, eg,
you can apply cuts while making histograms.
It runs both<ul>
<li>inside of STAF
<li>at the UNIX prompt (.xdf files)
</ul>

<h2>To run inside of TAS++</h2>
The table browser is available in TAS++, but not in the "regular"
TAS.  (TAS++ is TAS with a GUI interface.) To make TAS++ instead
of TAS, uncomment the MOTIF:= line in your bin/Makefile,
and add tbr at the beginning of LHS of the the ASPS line in
your Makefile.control.
After you have the STAF prompt, to bring up the browser type
<pre>                  tbr/motif/viewdataset
</pre>

<h2>To run at the UNIX prompt</h2>
From the UNIX prompt type (if tbr is not in your PATH, contact
starlib@bnl.gov)
<pre>        tbr myfile.xdf</pre>
You can generate <code>.xdf</code> files from STAF tables by
typing, for example,
<pre>        data_io/write myfile.xdf xdf table1 table2</pre>

<h2>Using the GUI interface</h2>

<strong>The primary window</strong> comes up immediately.
<ol>
<li>Click on the two-letter abbreviations until you see the table
    that you are interested in.  ("TB" and "tb" stand for "table".)
<li>Click on the <strong>name</strong> (not the abbreviation) for that table.
<li>Wait for the secondary window.
</ol><p>

<strong>The secondary window</strong>
comes up as a result of your actions in the primary window.
<ol>
<li>Click on the columns that you are interested in.
<li>Select which rows you want in the top right corner.
<li>Select a command from the "Action" menu.
</ol><p>
