<h1> Package tbr </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
This is package tbr (tABLE brOWSER).  It is an X/Xt/Motif program,
so you have to have an Xterminal, and set and export DISPLAY.

<h2>Getting started: </h2>
The browser is not glued to TAS runtime yet.
From the UNIX prompt type "<code>/u2/ward/tbr/bin/$ARCH/tbr myfile.xdf"
</code>.  You can generate <code>.xdf</code> files from TAS by
typing, for example, <code>data_io/write myfile.xdf xdf table1 table2</code>,
where <code>table1</code> and <code>table2</code>
are the names of the TAS tables you want to save.
<p>
 Pull down the help menu to "Getting Started".<p>
There are six GUI boxes labeled STEP1 to STEP6, but you don't have
to do all six steps each time (eg, STEP1 is "Choose Table", but
you only use the mouse in this box when you want to change tables).
However, when you are having trouble, you should check all six
"step"s.
<p>
There is enough on-line help that I don't want to type anything further
here.

<h2>Bugs and things left to do: </h2>
Things to do: Support table columns whose data types are arrays
in 2D histograms. Glue to TAS.  Support for re-sizing window.
