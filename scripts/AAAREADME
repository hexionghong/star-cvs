Quick summary of what script does what in this directory

 - ScanLog.pl   perl script interface to the Job failure cgi.
                This script scans a production log directory and
                fills a database with the eventual crash information
                it encounter.

 - RunDAQ.pm    perl module interface to the online DAQ database.
                Allows immediate copy of new records in the 
                operation database as well as manipulation of
                records.
 - DAQFill.pl   Script performing the transfer online -> operation
 - DAQFill.csh  csh interface suitable for a cron-job. A cronjob is
                currently running on rcas6003 under starreco


 - bfcca        Generic interface to the CRS batch system. Hopefully
                more flexible than the preceeding ones, this script
                should accomodate for all kind of option, chain, 
                multiple production from the same library version 
                etc ...
