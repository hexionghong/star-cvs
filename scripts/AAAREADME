Quick summary of what script does what in this directory

 - ScanLog.pl   perl script interface to the Job failure cgi.
                This script scans a production log directory and
                fills a database with the eventual crash information
                it encounter.

 - RunDAQ.pm    perl module interface to the online DAQ database.
                Allows immediate copy of new records in the 
                operation database as well as manipulation of
                records.
 - DAQFill.pl   Script performing the transfer online -> operation
 - DAQFill.csh  csh interface suitable for a cron-job. A cronjob is
                currently running on rcas6003 under starreco


 - bfcca        Generic interface to the CRS batch system. Hopefully
                more flexible than the preceeding ones, this script
                should accomodate for all kind of option, chain, 
                multiple production from the same library version 
                etc ...

 - ABUtils.pm   Per module controlling the entire set of compilation, 
                Insure compilation, HTML formatting of the results and
                test run + run-time output formatting. Changing this 
                module without understanding what it does may cause a
                complete collapse of all the other scripts. However, all
                output directories and setup are there so a single file
                change will update it all.
 - AutoBuild.csh cronjob oriented Wrapper script to ...
 - AutoBuild.pl Script managing library compilation. Use -h for help.
                There are numerous possible options, some of which are
                for library compilation debugging only. Noet that the 
                wrapper uses the '-u' option as a default.
 - insbld.pl    This script takes care of Insure++ compilation ONLY. Note
                that unlike AutoBuild.pl, this script is meant for anyboddy
                who wants to compile with Insure.
 - inssort.pl   Sort Insure++ compilation warning list and output an html.
                This script is called by insbld.pl . It was left separate
                to allow users to format their own insure compilaton results.
 - InsureTests.pl This script displays a list of possible Insure test runs.
                Results are automatically piped to a unique text based file
                name and formatted into HTML format by insrtm.pl .
 - insrtm.pl    This script takes care of Insure++ run-time error message
                formatting.
