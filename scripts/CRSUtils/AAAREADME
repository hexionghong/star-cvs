This directory contains scripts used on the CRS nodes (i.e. production). 
It has no use for users but are general and not library specific (so
does not fit in $STAR_MGR).

   submit.pl    latest version used in production. Uses the
                $STAR_SCRIPTS CRSQueues module.



FastOffline scripts belongs here as well since they can only
run on CRS farm gateway (rcrsuserXX).
